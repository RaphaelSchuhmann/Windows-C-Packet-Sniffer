# C Packet Sniffer
## main.c
This is the actual packet sniffer program. 
It is capable of getting the needed network device by it self but it is recommended to give it the device manually when starting the program.

## gdevs.c
Compile and run this file if you don't have something like **dumpcap** or **windump** installed on your device.

## Note
If you want to execute either of those two programs, you'll need both the (npcap sdk)[https://npcap.com/dist/npcap-sdk-1.15.zip] (Follow the compile.md) and the (npcap runtime)[https://npcap.com/dist/npcap-1.83.exe].
